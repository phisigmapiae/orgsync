            <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>National History</b></h3>
            <p>Fraternal orders have existed since 1427 B.C. Phi Sigma Pi was established on February 14, 1916 by founders Dr. Eldo L Hendricks, Dr. Claude A Phillips, and Dr. C. H. McClure. The fraternity was created at the State Teachers College at Warrensburg, Missouri, known today as Central Missouri State University. In 1921, it expanded into a &quot;National&quot; Fraternity, and then in 1966 a National &quot;Honor&quot; Fraternity.</p>

            <p>This award is the first, oldest, and most prestigious national award which can be bestowed upon an undergraduate chapter. The Outstanding Chapter Award was originally established in 1957, with one award being given every two years. Since 1966, the award has been given on an annual basis. Modifications were made to the criteria in 1970 to allow for up to three chapters per year to win the award, and it was renamed to honor Mr. Torchia for his outstanding contributions, years of service, and dedication to Phi Sigma Pi. Currently the criteria allows for 5% of the total collegiate chapters to be eligible for this award. Chapters are evaluated for this award on the basis of overall chapter activities as they strive to achieve a balance between scholarship, leadership, and fellowship.</p>
