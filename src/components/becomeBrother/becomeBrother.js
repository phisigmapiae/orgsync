          <h2 className="innerHeader">The Process To Become A Brother</h2>

          <hr color="#C2A26F" size="1px" />
          <p>The process to become a Brother of Phi Sigma Pi evolves over five distinct steps spread throughout the academic semester at West Chester University. Depending on holidays and the school calendar, some steps may be longer than others. After settling in during the first few weeks at school, Phi Sigma Pi will begin to recruit members to join. Recruiting only occurs in the spring and fall semesters; there is no summer recruitment. Below is a visual depiction/timeline of the five steps. Underneath are more details about each step.</p>

          <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>1. Info Nights</b></h3>
          <p>Held for 1 or 2 weeks at the beginning of the semester and highly publicized, info nights allow prospective members to become better oriented with the Fraternity from a broad perspective, with no obligation to join. It is a period where individuals may ask questions about the Fraternity. It is recommended to attend at least one info night in order to see if the Fraternity is right for you.</p>
          &nbsp;

          <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>2. Rush</b></h3>
          <p>Held for 1 or 2 weeks after info nights and also highly publicized, Rush consists of a series of dates when Phi Sigma Pi holds events open to the entire campus community that allow individuals to get to know the current Brothers. Each night may feature a different activity. Past rush activities include ultimate frisbee, pie-eating contests, making valentines for nursing home residents, game contests, volleyball, and cookouts. At the end of the Rush week(s), Brothers vote on the best candidates and those candidates are given a &quot;Bid&quot; to continue to the Initiation step.</p>
          &nbsp;

          <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>3. Initiation</b></h3>
          <p>After successfully receiving a Bid, the initiation process starts, which is the longest and most intensive part of the entire process. Usually between six to eight weeks, initiates become extremely oriented with the Fraternity, plan and participate in chapter events like socials and service projects, and interview brothers. Being unified with other initiates in one&#39;s Pledge Class is paramount. An Initiate Advisor is elected to serve as a guide during this step. A mid-semester evaluation is completed for each initiate to update him or her on both strengths and weaknesses. Successful completion of the initiation process is necessary to become a Brother of Phi Sigma Pi. Individuals who do not demonstrate the essential qualities of a brother will not be inducted into the chapter. During Final Vote, current Brothers vote to allow initiates to move to the next step.</p>
          &nbsp;

          <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>4. Spirit Week</b></h3>
          <p>Once given Final Vote, initiates become neo-phytes. During Spirit Week, neo-phytes participate in daily activities to celebrate their achievments. At the end of the week, an official induction ceremony is held.</p>
          &nbsp;

          <h3 className="subInnerHeader"><b>5. Induction</b></h3>
          <p>At the end of Spirit Week, neo-phytes are officially inducted as Brothers of Phi Sigma Pi.</p>
